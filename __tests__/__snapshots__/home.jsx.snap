              A little bit about us
            </h2>
            <p>
              Rad Plaid makes enriching your life with local music as simple, friendly, and delightful as possible. It's easy to feel overwhelmed when it comes to attending intimate shows, but based on your Spotify listening history, we'll find you the best shows to attend accompanied by songs from the show. Learn more about your local bands, local venues, even buy tickets—all before you step inside. Be part of your local music scene.

              How it all works
            </h2>
            <p>
              Show discovery for those yet to be discovered. We aim to be much more than just another way to fill your time on a Friday night. While we all love the band releasing their 12th record on their 40th world tour, we also believe that live local music matters; because even they were once just a local artist. So, based on your music history our algorithms find you the best shows featuring up-and-coming local artists—not just the popular ones. We believe the local music scene is important because the best ideas are often fragile and without a healthy support system they can be lost—leaving us with nothing more than the status quo.

              Why, as told by co-founder Sterling Salzberg
            </h2>
            <p>
              "I play in a band, I’ve booked shows, played in even more, but most importantly I’ve attended countless shows as a fan of music. Most of them local. A lot of shows for friends and with friends. However, since growing up in the Miami music scene, I’ve moved a lot and getting acclimated to a new music scene has always been difficult. I merely wanted a clear way to understand the artists, venues, and sounds of my new city. And..."

          Caitlin has always had a passion for entertaining and bringing people together. She’s taken that passion from Professional Event Coordinator to Chef and back again. She not only brings her ability to put on a good show to the Rad Plaid team, but the frustration of missing out on great bands while she could still see them in a tiny dive bar and approach them without a backstage pass.

          The only thing Sterling has worked on longer than web development is making music. For over 20 years Sterling has taken part in music scenes from Miami to Chicago to San Francisco. Ironically, in order to focus on music he began freelancing in web development, until his efforts took him all the way to companies such as

           During his over 10 years in the tech world, he's still managed to run a music production company, and put out 7 releases from 5 different music projects, with many more releases on the horizon. Music has always been where he's wanted to be and now he's taking what he knows about tech to make the music around him and those who make it, better and more accessible.

    Do we use 'cookies'?

  <p>
    Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

    California Online Privacy Protection Act
  </h2>
  <p>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

    COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
  </h2>
  <p>
    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

    Fair Information Practices
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
  </p>
  <h2
    className="typography-subheadline"
  >
    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
  </h2>
  <p>
    We will notify you via email:
  </p>
  <ul
    className="list list--default"
  >
    <li>
      Within 1 business day
    </li>
    <li>
      We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
    </li>
  </ul>
